### Number 463.
https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

### Number 409.
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

### Number 345.  
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

### Number 344.  
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Example: Given s = "hello", return "olleh".

### Number 38.
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.

### Number 345.
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.
Example 1:
Given s = "hello", return "holle".
Example 2:
Given s = "leetcode", return "leotcede".
